# ColorTread

A puzzle I designed years ago. I built it for iOS under the name Diags. Now, I'm porting it to javascript. You have an array of colors in a given order and a board of squares. You can swipe rows, columns and all primary and secondary diagonals. The goal is to get all squares to be the same color.
