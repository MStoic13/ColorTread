# ColorTread

A puzzle I designed years ago. I built it for iOS under the name Diags. Now, I'm porting it to javascript. You have an array of colors in a given order and a board of squares. You can swipe rows, columns and all primary and secondary diagonals. The goal is to get all squares to be the same color.

## Running

This is a static website. Download the repo into a folder and open main.html.

Enjoy!

## Personal ask

I generated the levels by doing various moves on a solved board and I would stop when I got some pretty pattern. So there is always a solution since all moves are reversible. I have not yet found an algorithm to solve this type of puzzle. If you find something, please start a discussion on the repo. I'd love to see your approach.
